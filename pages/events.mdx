# Events

By default all web3 events are auto-detected without any setup.

## Custom Events

If you want to send custom events to airblock then you can use the `track` function. Make sure to call the `init` function before sending any events.

```js
import * as airblock from "@airblock/sdk";

const API_KEY = ""; // required

airblock.init(API_KEY);
airblock.track("Button Clicked"); // this will send the event
```

## Flushing

The flush method triggers the client to send buffered events immediately. By default, flush is called automatically in an interval, if you want to flush the events all together, you can use the `flush` function, example:

```js
import * as airblock from "@airblock/sdk";

const API_KEY = ""; // required

airblock.init(API_KEY);
airblock.track("Button Clicked"); // this will send the event
airblock.track("Pro subscription bought");
airblock.flush();
```
