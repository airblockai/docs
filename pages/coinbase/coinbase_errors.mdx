# Coinbase Errors

The airblock SDK auto-detects web3 wallet related events but cannot auto-detect errors. This is the reason we have provided you with a `coinbase_error` function. You just need to provide the error to us in the function.

## Usage

```js
import * as airblock from "@airblock/js-sdk";

const API_KEY = ""; // required

airblock.init(API_KEY);

// Error handling
try {
  connectWallet();
} catch (err) {
  airblock.coinbase_error(err);
}
```
