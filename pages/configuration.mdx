# Configuration

## Options

`apiKey` - Required `string`. The apiKey of your project.

`optOut` - `boolean`. If optOut is `true`, the event isn't sent to Airblock's servers. Default value is `false`

`fingerprinting` - `boolean`. If fingerprinting is `false`, then the SDK doesn't generate fingerprints for any user. Default value is `true`

## Usage

To conigure the SDK we pass in some values in an object.

```js
import * as airblock from "@airblock/sdk";

const API_KEY = ""; // required

airblock.init(API_KEY, {
  optOut: false // not required,
  fingerprinting: true // not required
});
```
