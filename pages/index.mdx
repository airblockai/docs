# Getting Started

Use this quickstart guide to get started with airblock SDK.

## Prerequisites

You'll need Node.js and a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

## 1. Installing The SDK

Run `npm install --save @airblock/sdk` to install the SDK locally. We have built-in typescript support so you do not need to install the types for the SDK.

## 2. Usage

### Initialize the SDK

You must initialize the SDK before you can instrument any events. Your project's API key is required. After initialization the SDK will auto-detect web3 events.

```js
import * as airblock from "@airblock/sdk";

const API_KEY = ""; // required

airblock.init(API_KEY);
```
